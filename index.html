          <h3>Relax dude, it's just a prank</h3>
          <p>Don't worry, all your files are perfectly safe and aren't encrypted. While this was just a mere prank, 
               ransomwares are a big cybersecurity threat.
          For example, you may remember the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017 which spreads incredibly quickly throungh the EternalBlue exploit.
          </p>
          <p>Always be careful of what you download and don't connect to suspicious networks. Stay safe, both digitally and physically!</p>
