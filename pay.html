          <h3>Relax dude, it's just a prank</h3>
          <p>Don't worry, all your files are perfectly safe and aren't encrypted. While this was just a mere prank, 
               ransomwares are a big cybersecurity threat.
          For example, you may remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack">WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017</a> which spreads incredibly quickly through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EternalBlue">EternalBlue exploit</a> discovered by the NSA.
          </p>
          <p>If you were scared when you saw the 'All you files have been encrypted!' message, then may what to get a <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-beginners-guide-to-pc-backup">backup.</a></p>
          <p>Always be careful of what you download and don't connect to suspicious networks. Stay safe, both digitally and physically!</p>
